<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

It is a web application that uses information extracted from the Cens d'activitats econ√≤miques on the ground floor of the city of Barcelona to provide recommendations to small entrepreneurs.

It is a responsive application that allows the user to search by:
- Type of activity
- (Soon, search by neighborhood)
  
  The search will provide analysis of the situation of that business and the neighborhood to help the entrepreneur open their business.

- Density of businesses of that type in the neighborhood
- Average rental price
- Population by age in the neighborhood
- Distribution of that business in the different neighborhoods of Barcelona.
